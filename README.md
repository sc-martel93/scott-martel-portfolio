# Scott Martel Portfolio Page 

Welcome, to my portfolio web page which was completely designed and developed by me, Scott, to showcase some of my most recent and favorite projects. I used Figma to design the pages and edit photos and then implemented my designs using React JS and CSS. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me at the email below, thanks for visiting!
